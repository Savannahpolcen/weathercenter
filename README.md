# weathercenter

This is a work up for the weathercenter application . The project plan is to meet the following criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

# GitHub repository 

The repository for the weather center project is located at https://github.com/Savannahpolcen/weathercenter.

# Future Development 
This project was a complicated one for me. I struggled getting my head around the basis of the calls for individual buttons and even the layout for the site. So, in interest of furthur developments that I could work on in the future I would say location buttons, current day weather display as well as visual flow of the site.
